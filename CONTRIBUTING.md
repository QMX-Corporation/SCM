2. **Maintainer Review:** Every PR will be audited and reviewed by the Project Administrator (dev12124). If any architectural violations are found, the PR will be canceled immediately.
3. **No Spaghetti Code:** Keep code modular, clean, and strictly aligned with ANSI C or NASM Assembly. Unused functions, temporary logs, or unsafe pointers will be rejected.
